####Data graphing assignment.
=========================

This project will be graphing results from my brothers pentathlon competition.


==========================

The program displays the total points for each of the athletes in the competition in two bar charts.
The first is a 2D barchart and the second is a 3D barchart. 
You can switch between barcharts with a toggle on the left of the screen.
